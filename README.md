If you want to implement Snippyly in react typescript app using cdn method then please follow below steps:

1. Copy `declarations.d.ts` file in `src/types` folder.
2. Copy `loadSnippyly.ts` file in `src` folder to load Snippyly from cdn.
3. Add `SnippylyContext.ts` file in `src/context` folder.
4. Refer `App.tsx` code to load Snippyly and initialize it with your api key.
5. Refer `Toolbar.tsx` file to set user in Snippyly.
6. If you want to show user cursors then add `<snippyly-cursor></snippyly-cursor>` in `App.tsx` file.
7. If you want to show user presence then add `<snippyly-presence></snippyly-presence>`. In this demo, this tag is added in `Toolbar.tsx` component, but it can be added in any other component you want.
